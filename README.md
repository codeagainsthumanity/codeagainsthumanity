# Code Against Humanity - Overview

Team members: Jane Hur, Jack Kinne, Renee Messick

## Project overview:

Code Against Humanity is a web version of the popular game, [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/). In the basic game, a question is posed with a black card, which the user answers with a white card. For this app, card content will be generated from [JSON Against Humanity](https://crhallberg.com/cah/). Users will be able to create a profile/account, login, edit thier preferences, and play the game.
