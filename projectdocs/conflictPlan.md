# Code Against Humanity - Conflict Plan

## What will our group do when it encounters conflict?

- All disagreements will be resolved through popular vote. Once the decision has been made there will no longer be further debate, but the group will move forward adopting the agreed upon decision.

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- We will address our concerns in our end-of-day standup. What we worked on, any blockers, who can help/ how they can be helped.
- Concerns will be raised in the morning standup if the same issue becomes necessary to express to the instructor team.
- We will always do our best to give each other the benfit of a doubt.

## What is your process to resolve conflicts?

- Take reasonable breaks( walk, get beverages, food, etc) at our own volition
- Allow people time to cool off if necessary
- Make sure we respect each other's right to discuss their feelings and ideas.

## How and when will you escalate the conflict resolution?
